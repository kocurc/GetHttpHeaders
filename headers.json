{
	"server": "Server:The Server header describes the software used by the origin server that handled the request â€” that is, the server that generated the response.",
	"date": "The Date general HTTP header contains the date and time at which the message was originated.",
	"content-type": "The Content-Type entity header is used to indicate the media type of the resource.",
	"transfer-encoding": "The Transfer-Encoding header specifies the form of encoding used to safely transfer the payload body to the user.",
	"connection": "The Connection general header controls whether or not the network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes. If the value sent is keep-alive, the connection is persistent and not closed, allowing for subsequent requests to the same server to be done.",
	"vary": "The Vary HTTP response header determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server. It is used by the server to indicate which headers it used when selecting a representation of a resource in a content negotiation algorithm.",
	"content-security-policy": "The HTTP Content-Security-Policy response header allows web site administrators to control resources the user agent is allowed to load for a given page. With a few exceptions, policies mostly involve specifying server origins and script endpoints. This helps guard against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS).",
	"x-dns-prefetch-control": "The X-DNS-Prefetch-Control HTTP response header controls DNS prefetching, a feature by which browsers proactively perform domain name resolution on both links that the user may choose to follow as well as URLs for items referenced by the document, including images, CSS, JavaScript, and so forth.",
	"x-frame-options": "The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame>, <iframe>, <embed> or <object>. Sites can use this to avoid click-jacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.",
	"strict-transport-security": "The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.",
	"x-content-type-options": "The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed. This is a way to opt out of MIME type sniffing, or, in other words, to say that the MIME types are deliberately configured.",
	"x-xss-protection": "The HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Although these protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers when sites implement a strong Content-Security-Policy that disables the use of inline JavaScript ('unsafe-inline'), they can still provide protections for users of older web browsers that don't yet support CSP.",
	"set-cookie": "The Set-Cookie HTTP response header is used to send a cookie from the server to the user agent, so the user agent can send it back to the server later. To send multiple cookies, multiple Set-Cookie headers should be sent in the same response.",
	"cache-control": "The Cache-Control HTTP header holds directives (instructions) for caching in both requests and responses. A given directive in a request does not mean the same directive should be in the response.",
	"content-encoding": "The Content-Encoding entity header is used to compress the media-type. When present, its value indicates which encodings were applied to the entity-body. It lets the client know how to decode in order to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header.",
	"accept-ch": "The Accept-CH header is set by the server to specify which Client Hints headers a client should include in subsequent requests.",
	"accept-ch-lifetime": "The Accept-CH-Lifetime header is set by the server to specify the persistence of Accept-CH header value that specifies for which Client Hints headers client should include in subsequent requests.",
	"unknown": "Unknown definition."
